# AWS Glacier Backup

## Description
Shell script for creating, encrypting, splitting and pushing archives to AWS Glacier.

This will create a directory at __/opt/aws-glacier-backup/COMPLETED_JOBS__ with the name of your archive concatenated with the date and time.
Inside will be a manifest of all files in the archive and two json files with Glacier related metadata.
